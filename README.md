HyScript7's Puzzle Game

I tried making this as customizable as i can.
You can add questions in Questions.yaml and add color schemes in colors.txt

# Information
Yes, you need all the files inside the folder, whenever it is Compiled or Source.
If you attempt running the source code but encounter errors, try installing the PyYAML library. ( Currently the only one not defaulty installed )

# Origin
This project started as a challange with my friend.
We decided to race in who can make a better puzzle game in under 30 minutes.

# "License"
You can do whatever you want with this source code.
But please, credit me if you decide to fork.
